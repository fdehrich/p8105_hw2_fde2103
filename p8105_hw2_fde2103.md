## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df =
  read_xlsx(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data for 2018 and 2017.

``` r
precip_2018 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 =
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation dataframes. The technique being used
(creating a “helper” tibble) was presented by Jeff during the live
session.

``` r
month_df =
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df =
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017)

precip_df =
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  select(year, month_name, total, -month) # Reordering the variables to be in a more useful order and getting rid of the old month variable
```

**Mr. Trash Wheel data** (`trashwheel_df`)

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trash Wheel trash
collector in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the
trash wheel collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The
dataset contains information on year, month, and trash collected,
including some specific kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in
our final dataset.

The median number of sports balls found in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

**Preciptation data** (`precip_df`)

This dataset contains the total preceiptation per month for 2017 and
2018. There are a total of 24 rows in our final dataset.

The total precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the NYC Transit data (including converting the entry
variable from character to logical).

``` r
transit_df =
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
           col_types = cols( # Making sure the route variables are character
             Route1 = col_character(),
             Route2 = col_character(),
             Route3 = col_character(),
             Route4 = col_character(),
             Route5 = col_character(),
             Route6 = col_character(),
             Route7 = col_character(),
             Route8 = col_character(),
             Route9 = col_character(),
             Route10 = col_character(),
             Route11 = col_character()
             )
           ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select( # Selecting the desired variables
    line,
    station_name,
    station_latitude,
    station_longitude,
    route1:route11,
    entry,
    vending,
    entrance_type,
    ada
    ) %>% 
  mutate(
    entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE), # Converting the entry variable from character to logical
    vending = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE), # Converting the vending variable from character to logical
    )
```

This dataset provides various types of information regarding NYC subway
stations and their entrances/exits. The variables in the dataset are:
line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, its routes 1
through 11 (each route captured as its own variable), whether or not
there is entry, entrance type, and whether or not it is ADA compliant.
So far, I have read the dataset, reformatted the names using
`janitor::clean_names()`, selected the variables that I would like to
keep, converted the `entry` and `vending` variables from character to
logical, and ensured that all route variables are character. There are
1868 rows and 19 columns in the dataset. These data could be tidier. In
particular, the route information is displayed in a “wide” fashion and
could be combined into two variables (one that expresses route number
and one that expresses route name).

There are 465 distinct stations.

84 stations are ADA compliant.

93.8436831% of the station entrances/exits without vending allow
entrance.

Now I will reformat the data so that route number and route name are
distinct variables.

``` r
transit_df_tidy =
  pivot_longer(
    transit_df,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_number",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route_name",
    names_repair = "minimal"
    )
```

60 distinct stations serve the A train.

Of the stations that serve the A train, 17 are ADA compliant.

## Problem 3

Read and clean the data in pols.month.csv.

``` r
pols_df =
  read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-") %>% # Break up the mon variable
  mutate(
    month = as.numeric(month),
    prez_gop = ifelse(prez_gop == "0", FALSE, TRUE), # Coverting the prez variables from numeric to logical
    prez_dem = ifelse(prez_dem == "0", FALSE, TRUE)
    )
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   mon = col_date(format = ""),
    ##   prez_gop = col_double(),
    ##   gov_gop = col_double(),
    ##   sen_gop = col_double(),
    ##   rep_gop = col_double(),
    ##   prez_dem = col_double(),
    ##   gov_dem = col_double(),
    ##   sen_dem = col_double(),
    ##   rep_dem = col_double()
    ## )

*Note: For the `prez_gop` variable, I noticed that there were some
entries that contained “2”. I think this might relate the Nixon/Ford
transition, but, in any case, I am coding “2” (in addition to “1”) as
“TRUE”.*

Here, using the strategy Jeff presented during the live session, I am
replace month number with month name. I am also creating a `president`
variable taking values `gop` and `rep`, removing `prez_dem` and
`prez_gop`, and removing the `day` variable.

``` r
pols_df =
  left_join(pols_df, month_df, by = "month") %>% 
  select(-month) %>% # Getting rid of the old month variable
  relocate(year, month_name) %>% # Putting the new month variable up near the front
  pivot_longer(
    c(prez_dem, prez_gop),
    names_to = "president",
    names_prefix = "prez_",
    values_to = "prez_values"
    ) %>% 
  filter(prez_values == TRUE) %>% 
  select(-prez_values, -day) # No longer need this prez_values variable, also getting rid of the day variable per the instructions
```
